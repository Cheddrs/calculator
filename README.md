## Summary

<image src="media/readme_screenshot.png">

This project really pushed forward my understanding of JavaScript. I was able to incorporate some newer features of the language, like writing my first couple of arrow functions.

I also wrote code to utilize the localStorage API for the browser by setting up memory save, recall, and clear buttons on my calculator.
